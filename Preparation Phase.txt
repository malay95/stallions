1.	Preparation Phase

	1.1		What was our game plan? 

    Since we knew we would have just a couple of hours to find and automate exploits we decided to build a library with a lot of functions. 
    We didnâ€™t know what kind of vulnerable services we will encounter so, we developed multiple generic tools for finding different kind of vulnerabilities. 
		
	Instead of making these tools too specific, we have an option to provide arguments to do more directed attacks.

	1.2		What tools did we think were necessary prior to the CTF? Why did we feel this way?

	The following is the list of tools we built:

	GOT attack:
	GOT analysis:
	Get form fields:
	Buffer overflow:
	SQL injection identifier:
	SQL Union injection:
	Connect_Link:	
		
	These can be used for basic analysis to find possible buffer overflow, SQL injection and GOT vulnerability. If we find for example, a service vulnerable 
	to GOT attack we can then take the result of GOT analysis and give them as arguments to GOT attack tool to do a more direct attack.

	1.3		What procedures did we put in place beforehand and how did we distribute the workload (for scripts and during the final CTF)

	We made sure that we test the tools on vulnerable services before we include them in the final library that would be used during the CTF. We also created a 
	backup script having learnt from the last CTF that everything should be backed up before we try to patch things. 

	Each of us worked on different tools and made one person responsible for the integration of these tools in a library. The workload was distributed as below:

	1.	GOT attack: Dhrumil Shah, Salil Malik
	2.	GOT analysis: Dhrumil Shah, Salil Malik
	3.	Buffer overflow: 
	4.	Get form fields: 
	5.	SQL injection identifier:
	6.	SQL Union injection
	7.	Connect_Link: 
	8. 	Integration of the library:

	During the CTF, we decided that we will split into groups of two to work together on different attacks.
